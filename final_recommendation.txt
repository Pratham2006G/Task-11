Final Recommendation – A/B Test Analysis


An A/B test was conducted to compare the performance of advertisements (Ad group) with public service announcements (PSA group).


The conversion rate of the Ad group is higher than the PSA group.
A chi-square test was used to evaluate whether this difference is statistically significant.


The p-value obtained from the test is 0.00259, which is less than the significance level of 0.05.
Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected.


Recommendation:
Based on the results, advertisements lead to a significantly higher conversion rate compared to PSA.
It is recommended to continue using advertisements to maximize user conversions.
